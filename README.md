# Groups++

## Notes

This is a fork to restrict selection to open (type=4) groups only. Ideally this would be a user-settable option but to suit my needs I've hard-coded it. Please install or fork from Senky's version instead of this one. 

## Installation

Copy the extension to phpBB/ext/senky/groupspp

Go to "ACP" > "Customise" > "Extensions" and enable the "Groups++" extension.
